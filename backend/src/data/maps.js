        order_num: 2,
        description: 'A crumbling residential complex where James begins his search in earnest. Mannequins and Lying Figures stalk its dark hallways. Pyramid Head makes his full debut in a nightmarish locked room — beyond a grate, he brutalizes two Mannequins in a scene designed to provoke revulsion, not just fear.',

        description: "The dark water at the heart of everything. James crosses it alone by motorboat, guided only by a tattered map. The lake's surface is impossibly still. No light reflects on it. On the far shore, through the fog, the silhouette of the Lakeview Hotel waits.",

The hotel shifts into the Otherworld for the final encounters.",
