        title: 'The Letter from Beyond',
        content: 'James Sunderland received a letter from his wife, Mary — who has been dead for three years. In the letter, written in her voice, she speaks of their "special place" in Silent Hill and asks him to find her there. What draws him isn\'t hope, but something darker: guilt he cannot name and a truth he cannot face.',

        title: 'The Fog World',
        content: 'Silent Hill exists between two states. The Fog World is the town as James first sees it — gray, oppressive, and muffled by a perpetual mist that rolls in off Toluca Lake. Streets are empty, cars sit abandoned, and a static hiss from a pocket radio warns of creatures nearby. The fog is not weather. It is the town breathing.',

        title: 'The Otherworld',
        content: 'Without warning, Silent Hill shifts into the Otherworld — a nightmare version of itself made of rust, wire, industrial grating, and decay. Walls peel back like flesh. Ceilings collapse into black voids. The architecture becomes a physical representation of inner torment. For James, it is a prison. For Angela, it is always on fire.',

        title: 'The Nature of the Monsters',
        content: 'No two visitors to Silent Hill see the same monsters. The creatures James encounters are born from his own psyche. The Mannequins — two incomplete female lower-halves fused together — reflect his fractured, sexualized view of the women in his life. The Nurses, sensuous yet violent, embody the same distorted desire mixed with the hospital setting of Mary\'s death.',

        title: 'Pyramid Head\'s True Purpose',
        content: 'Pyramid Head is not a random monster assigned to torment James. He is a punishment James has conjured for himself — a judge and executioner born from James\'s subconscious need to be punished for what he did. Every time Pyramid Head appears, it is a confrontation James is not yet ready to survive. He cannot be killed because James has not yet faced the truth.',

        title: 'Toluca Lake and the Town\'s History',
        content: 'Toluca Lake sits at the center of Silent Hill like a dark eye. The town has a history of cults, disappearances, and unexplained phenomena stretching back centuries. It is said the town itself is alive — a psychic wound that draws the guilty, the grieving, and the broken to its shores, then reflects their inner world back at them until they either confront it or are consumed.',

        title: 'Mary\'s Letter — The Real Words',
        content: '"In my restless dreams, I see that town. Silent Hill. You promised you\'d take me there again someday. But you never did. Well, I\'m alone there now... In our \'special place\'... Waiting for you." The letter ends with an impossible promise from a dead woman. But by the time James finds the truth, he understands: the letter was never a beacon of hope. It was an accusation.',
