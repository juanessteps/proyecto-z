    // Weapons
    { id: 1, name: 'Wooden Plank', type: 'weapon', description: 'A sturdy piece of lumber James finds near Rosewater Park. It\'s heavy enough to cave in a Lying Figure\'s chest. Crude, but immediately available.' },
    { id: 2, name: 'Steel Pipe', type: 'weapon', description: 'More durable and longer-reaching than the plank. A reliable melee weapon found throughout the apartments and hospital.' },
    { id: 3, name: 'Handgun', type: 'weapon', description: 'A semi-automatic pistol found in Rosewater Park. Standard stopping power. Ammo is relatively common, making it James\'s most-used firearm.' },
    { id: 4, name: 'Shotgun', type: 'weapon', description: 'Pump-action. Found in the Woodside Apartments. Devastating at close range — ideal for stopping Mannequins and Flesh Lips before they close distance.' },
    { id: 5, name: 'Rifle', type: 'weapon', description: 'A bolt-action hunting rifle with a scope. Found in the Historical Society. Slow rate of fire, but its precision makes it lethal at range.' },

    { id: 7, name: 'Great Knife', type: 'weapon', description: 'Pyramid Head\'s iconic weapon. Impossibly heavy, dragged with effort across the floor. James cannot truly wield it — he can only briefly use it. The symbolism is not subtle.' },
    // Health

    { id: 13, name: 'Rifle Rounds', type: 'ammo', description: 'Rare bolt-action rounds. Each shot must count. The rifle ammo scarcity reinforces the weapon\'s intended role as a precision tool.' },
    // Key Items
    { id: 14, name: 'Room 312 Key', type: 'key', description: 'The key to Room 312 of the Lakeview Hotel — the room where James and Mary shared their last days together. It opens the door to the truth.' },
